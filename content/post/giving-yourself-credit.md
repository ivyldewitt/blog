*Author's note: This post was originally titled "you're awesome and should feel awesome", but I realized that might be a bit of a mouthful.*

For nearly all people who are learning to code on a non-traditional path (self study, bootcamps, etc.) it's easy to experience feelings of doubt and discouragement. Not only can it be difficult going through the basics - picking a language, finding a good resource, and sticking to it without the structure of more traditional learning.

As I mentioned in my [previous blog](https://zentechnista.github.io/2017/07/lessons-in-programming-learning-to-get-uncomfortable/) on learning to get uncomfortable with coding, there's always feelings of resistance when you're teaching yourself a new skill. Additionally, it's important to focus on the skills you've gained up to this point, instead of criticizing yourself on skills that you don't have.

## So what does this have to do with not giving yourself enough credit?

As a new programmer, you have the benefit of coming into software development with fresh eyes and an unique perspective. You have the ability to carve out your own path, join an amazing community of coders, and begin a journey to learn an invaluable skill (I think computers are pretty magical if you haven't caught that already).

But programming isn't an easy skill, and can include long hours of frustration, confusion, and feelings of defeat. Sometimes, instead of wearing your newbie programming credentials as a badge of honor, it ends up feeling like a crutch. You end up in a learning-plateau loop (*raise your hand if you sometimes feel like you've taken every 'Intro to X' course in the world*), and instead of building on your skills, you feel stilted instead.

**Hint: This is the time where you need to start giving yourself more credit!**

In my experience, this happens because of one of two reasons:

1. You get very comfortable in one area of programming and no longer want to leave the nest.
2. You're worried about once you move into more advanced areas you're going to hit a block and be (*read: feel*) back at square one again.

Either due to comfort, fear, or both, you end up staying in the same spot (*from here only aptly named the Low-Credit Loop*) and not building onto what you've already accomplished or realizing your full potential.

## What I can do to get of the Low-Credit Loop?

![Fist-Pump](https://firesidetech.files.wordpress.com/2017/08/rawpixel-com-250087_aferei.jpg)

First off, seriously give yourself some credit to how far you've come since you've started your journey. Even if it's only been a few months, write down everything you've accomplished from now until then and be grateful! Every day you've studied programming is a successful day, and even if you check in with yourself once a month, you'd be surprised how much you learned over time. As one of my favorite teachers Todd McLeod says in his [Learn to Code with Go course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oxtp9Puk_Y4) (paraphrased):

>"Drop by drop, the bucket gets filled. And after you've been coding for months, years, etc. the bucket fills up even more. With patience and persistence you can succeed."

This Code Check-In that you do can also be a great resource for figuring out exactly how you want to move forward in your coding career, and seeing how your goals have or haven't changed over time. This allows you to hone your focus, and think on what you can do to keep yourself focused & motivated.

Still, writing about your goals is just half the battle. Here are my favorite tips for getting out of the Low-Credit Loop and giving yourself the credit you deserve:

#### Work on a small scale project - one that's just enough to get you into some muddy waters but not completely out of your depth to leave you confused.

For example, I'm working on a mini-project were I take some of the FreeCodeCamp [algorithm challenges](https://www.freecodecamp.org/challenges/get-set-for-our-algorithm-challenges) and try to solve them in Go. You can view my repository [here](https://github.com/zentechnista/go_fcc) for the curious. Algorithms are a great way to hone your computational thinking skills, and there are enough small scale ones to put a bit of pressure on you without being overwhelming.

#### Join meetups - either ones on a new topic or just general project nights.

In my opinion, project night meetups are amazing as it's way to interact with other people's code and the opportunity to have your own code reviewed. For self-studiers, it's an invaluable resource for learning how to work with other developers.

#### Try to build something that you're only 60% familiar with.

My greatest example - this site! I came in knowing only a little bit about GitHub pages and a stubborn determination to build a static website with [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/). Because Go is life, naturally. I made numerous mistakes - some sillier than others - and probably learned more about templating, HTTP, and hosting than I would have if I just looked at a tutorial and called it a day. It was a fun experience and I learned a lot from it. There's a lot of accomplishment that comes with diving into the unknown and coming out only (partly) unscathed.  


**Bonus Tips:**

Read [Think Like A Programmer](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1593274246/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=1593274246&linkCode=as2&tag=lavienco0c-20&linkId=YS757B5QBUKZWUIP) by V. Anton Spraul. If you're feeling stuck on  algorithm challenges this book is a great resource to hone your computational thinking skills.

Read [Mastery](https://smile.amazon.com/Mastery-Keys-Success-Long-Term-Fulfillment-ebook/dp/B01ND0X91Y/ref=sr_1_1?s=digital-text&ie=UTF8&qid=1500946622&sr=1-1&keywords=mastery+george+leonard+kindle) by George Leonard. Truthfully one of the best resources on Mastery-Based Learning, and something to keep on your bookshelf when you need that extra boost of motivation.

And as always, I leave you with a programming quote:
