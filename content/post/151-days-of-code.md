Like many, I took

A lot of people who have completed the challenge wanted to repeat it, because of the impact it had on their results and how it sped up their learning process.

I believe that retaking the challenge is very valuable, but you need to have a way of measuring and analyzing your progress, to be able to improve your plan and outcomes for the next round.

Let’s say you’re about to finish your first round of the challenge. I suggest that after you’ve completed the 100th day, you take 3–4 days off (you can still code, but not as part of the challenge) to pause and reflect on how the experience was for you.

The best way to do this is to write your thoughts into a blog post, or even in a notebook. The main thing is that you start the process of reflection.

This process will reveal a lot of things you didn’t think about initially, which you can transform into lessons about yourself and about the experience itself by the process of thinking about the journey you’ve just completed.

At the very least, take this time just to celebrate, because you deserve it.

Then, armed with the knowledge you’ve synthesized, plan your next round of #100DaysOfCode.

    What technologies you want to get into?
    What projects you want to build

Don’t make your plan too detailed. You don’t want to stifle your own energy as you go along, and you want to give yourself plenty of room to adapt. Just note the general themes and guidelines you will follow.

With the new system of #100DaysOfCode rounds in mind, I suggest we adopt a new way of noting the day you are on, when you are making your daily update on Twitter. For example, R2D23, where R stands for which round you’re on, and D stands for the day. (This example can be read as: Round 2 Day 23.)

After a few rounds of the challenge, you’ll be able to compare the rounds and gather even more valuable data about how you learn, what works for you, and what doesn’t.
