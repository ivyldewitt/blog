"Learning to get uncomfortable." Kind of a weird article topic for a blog post right? There's tons of articles on FOMO (Fear of Missing Out for the uninitiated), ignoring FOMO, sticking on the path of mastery, never giving up, knowing how to give up, etc.

<!--more-->

Not withstanding the amount of articles talking about how difficult it can be to code, ways to stay motivated, people who have jumped on and off the wagon, etc. While doing the
[#100DaysOfCode Challange](https://medium.freecodecamp.com/join-the-100daysofcode-556ddb4579e4) I definitely read a lot of those resources myself. My #100DaysOfCode challenge was a lot of fun, even as it got a bit jumbled with other responsibilities such as work, job searching etc.

Within that challenge I learned a lot of amazing new skills (and got an amazing new job as a support engineer!) such as SQL, MySQL, Python, Database Design, and now Golang. I definitely still consider myself an "Advanced Beginner", but I feel comfortable enough in my skills regarding database development and taking on small projects using my favored languages (mostly Python & Go still).

Despite everything that I've learned and all of the new insights I've gained into programming in general, I wish I had focused on one thing at the onset of my journey: learning to get uncomfortable. Programming is fun, exciting, and one of the most enjoyable hobbies I've ever picked up. It can also be very difficult and frustrating at times. It's easy to try to 'get around' the difficulty but either trying the next shiny new language or switching to a different topic (I've done it myself a few times), but in the interests of [Mastery-Based Learning](https://firesidetech.wordpress.com/2017/03/03/the-developers-journey-to-mastery/) it's important to learn how to be uncomfortable with programming at times.

If this doesn't relate to you at all - awesome! Keep programming and having fun. But if at times programming makes you feel like this:

Then below are a few tips on how to get you through your coding hurdles, and how to keep your learn to code journey fun.

## Allow yourself to take breaks

![Relaxing](https://firesidetech.files.wordpress.com/2017/05/kyle-ryan-16660.jpg)

This one seems a bit counter intuitive at first - why would you want to take breaks on your coding journey when you're trying to get skilled as fast as possible?

It's easy, especially when you're doing a timed coding challenge to think of everything as a sprint. Instead of the usual marathon comparison, I encourage people to think of coding as writing a thesis or a similarly long dissertation. If you've written a thesis or know someone who's written a thesis, you know that they're taking on a long project on a topic that typically ranges from highly specialized to widely comprehensive. At times it can get very dry, and even at its highest points there's a level of understanding that you're always learning about the topics and that your research is ongoing.

Programming can be similar to this - and especially if you're juggling working full time, school, family, and other life responsibilities, the difficulty can weigh on you. That's why it's important to know when to take a short break from programming. It can be a few days, or maybe just a week where you review concepts instead of actively trying to struggle through a new concept. The point is to take your time, and if you take a break for a few days instead of ramming through new concepts, that just gives it more time for you to comprehend them.


## Find the best learning style for you

![Reading](https://firesidetech.files.wordpress.com/2017/05/aaron-burden-236415.jpg)

There's a lot of literature on learning styles, but for programming in particular its incredibly important to be able to fully understand the material - and even more importantly, having a path/resource to answer questions when you're stuck.

I really encourage new (and intermediate) coders to try a variety of resources to learn to code. Maybe it's something like Free Code Camp, or maybe you prefer video-style instructions such as Coursera, EdX, or Udemy. Books, documentation, in-person classes, and boot-camps are all valid styles of learning.

It depends on how self-directed you are and how much mentor ship you'd like to rely on. And this takes time - it may be months or a year until you find the best mix of resources for you.

If you're interested in figuring out your learning style, you can get started with this [quiz](http://www.educationplanner.org/students/self-assessments/learning-styles-quiz.shtml).

## Review the tools in your toolbox

![toolbox](https://firesidetech.files.wordpress.com/2017/05/la-compagnie-robinson-239140.jpg)

One of the most common things new programmers hear is "to improve, start working on your own projects." This can be really frustrating, especially because more often than not, you don't know where to start. Often, new programmers over or understate their abilities, which leads them to working on projects that end up being either too simple and keeping them in their comfort zone, or too difficult and pushes people to give up.

To combat this, keep a log of all of the information you've gained up to this point. I like to recap at the end of every week what I've learned so far outside of the standard #100DaysOfCode challenge. Log your skills, new insights, and any tricks or tips you've learned since then. Keeping a running list of your current skills will allow you to assess what types of projects you may be suited for - for example, taking on the Free Code Camp algorithms versus Open Source Society projects.


## Learn to love the struggle

![struggle](https://firesidetech.files.wordpress.com/2017/05/sandis-helvigs-115107.jpg)


This is probably the most obvious, but also the most important. Like any skill, the path to programming will involve lots of long nights, hair-pulling, intense focus, pushing yourself beyond your comfort zone, and joining an amazing community of fellow learners.

Understand that it's OK to struggle, and OK to have days where you just want to give up. To take a quote from the fantastic [Learning to Code: When It Gets Dark](https://medium.freecodecamp.com/learning-to-code-when-it-gets-dark-e485edfb58fd)  article by Andrew Kalloway, remember this:


> Imagine how many people out of those who have started coding on roughly the same day as you did have already quit — or will quit today — giving in to the same temptation to stop the > pain and discomfort of learning.
>

For as long as you've kept on this journey, think about how much you've learned since you started. As concepts get clearer, keep on that path and push forward. At times, it'll still feel like a slog, but every day you've continued to code is another day pushing you towards your eventual goal of becoming a developer.

As always, I leave you with a programming quote. Happy coding!
