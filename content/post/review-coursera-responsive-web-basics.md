In the midst of learning Go and spending some time practicing Python, I decided that I wanted to brush up on my front-end skills and quickly review HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

To start off, the instructors are very good - despite how oddly the content is structured at times, they do a great job of presenting it in a clear and concise way. 
Unfortunately, the core weakness of the course lies in how the content is present. While this is a beginner course, the content jumps around substantially in a way that doesn't give a beginner enough time or resources to full grasp the material. Seriously, only covering the DOM with jQuery and just briefly touching on JavaScript document.getElementById in a quiz seems incredibly rushed and doesn't provide the foundational knowledge in JavaScript that I would expect from a course of this nature. 
As a result, I can't really recommend this course or the specialization, as it focuses on outdated material, does not provide the foundational knowledge I would expect, which may prepare you to complete the specialization, but not have the full skills to be a web developer.
