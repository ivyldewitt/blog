Roughly about 3 months ago to the day, I made an exciting decision to leave my previous job to join an e-commerce and social analytics startup. It wasn't a particularly difficult decision - I'm pretty sure wanting to hide under a rock ever Monday morning is *not* a great sign that you're enjoying your current position - but still, it represented a level of change that was both fun and intimidating.

<!--more-->

So where does that leave me three months now? As someone who is very persistent and determined (yay!) but a terrible scheduler (seriously, I'm the queen of unused planners) I thrive on less openly structured forms of learning. It's probably why I've been so fond of [Mastery-Based Learning](https://firesidetech.wordpress.com/2017/02/15/lessons-in-programming-on-mastery-and-progress/), and focused on gradually improving my programming skills over the last 6 months. I wanted to move away from focusing on time-based goals and learning systems and decided to do the following:

>Instead of focusing on deadlines and set goals, aka “I want to be a programmer in 6 months”, I’m focusing on more comprehensive goals such as “gaining the skills to have a life-long career in software engineering”, and “understanding the fundamentals of programming so that I >can apply those techniques in any language”.

Basically, I decided to stop seeing my programming journey as a sprint:

And decided to see it as a journey without a end date (but always with a direction).

I learned a lot from that experience, and it changed not just how I went about my programming goals, but how I viewed my current skills in relation to my overall, long-term ambitions. While my eventual goal is to become a software engineer, I'm pretty good a being a medium between developers and the people who use their products, hence my current position as a client support engineer. It's easy to undervalue soft skills, but I'm working towards improving my skills in both technical and non-technical areas now.

Since I decided to pursue [Mastery-Based Learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mastery_learning), I've also been fortunate to have the following experiences:

* Started learning [Golang](https://www.pluralsight.com/blog/software-development/golang-get-started), an amazingly simple, scalable and performant language.
* Learned [SQL](https://community.modeanalytics.com/sql/tutorial/introduction-to-sql/) for work admittedly, but I did get a [post](https://firesidetech.wordpress.com/2017/03/14/the-beginners-guide-to-database-design-part-1/) or [two](https://firesidetech.wordpress.com/2017/04/11/the-beginners-guide-to-database-design-part-2/) on Database Design out of it, so definitely worth it.
* Pushing myself to attend more meetups - primarily with GDI Philly and groups like Code for Philly (haven't attended any Golang Philly meetups yet but they're on the horizon)
* Completed the [#100DaysOfCode challenge](https://medium.freecodecamp.org/the-100daysofcode-movement-rounds-resistance-and-adaptation-432429cc3306).
* And last (for now) but not least, learned how to create my own static website with GoHugo & GitHub pages!

I still have a long ways to go, but as I continue to revise my own plans, study habits, and pathways I hope the rest of you will continue to learn with me.

And as always I leave you with a programming quote:

>"Learning to code is the single best thing anyone can do to get the most out of the amazing future in front of us." - Marc Andreessen

Happy Coding!
