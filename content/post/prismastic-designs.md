One of the most exciting (and difficult) parts of pursing any career is to step out of your comfort zone and start working towards your goals. There’s the mix of ‘am I going to be taken seriously‘, ‘am I truly ready for this‘, etc. But like all things, sometimes you just need to get your feet wet in order to make any progress and move forward.

In December of 2016, I was lucky enough to have the opportunity to work with my coworker Phil on his [website](https://www.prism-products.us/), an online store where they offer high quality new and used equipment for drummers – i.e. “Do It Yourself meets the Electronic Drum world” style. Prism is a great resource for new/upcoming musicians who need great, yet reasonably priced electronic drums and related equipment. It was an amazing vision, and I was really excited to start working on this project.

When programming and designing sites, I prefer to cover three specific goals at the onset of a projects:

* **Autonomy & Ease of Use:** How much autonomy does the client want over the site? Do they want to be able to create and update on their own? Or will they request my services whenever a major change needs to be made?
* **Format & Platform:** Regarding the initial set-up – will this project be made from the ground up or will it be hosted/created using a CMS such as WordPress or Squarespace?
* **Authorship:** How are you managing the site? Who is going to be creating & updating content?

Usually, clients will throw out their ideas and I will provide input and updates afterwards. I also will determine how comfortable the client is with website management as well. After completing the initial discussion process with Phil, I was able to determine the following goals:

* **Autonomy and Ease of Use:** After I complete the project, he would have autonomy over updating the site.
* **Format & Platform:** I choose Squarespace as the CMS, due to its customizability, ease of use and great, clear-cut documentation.
* **Authorship:** Since my coworker will be the sole manager of the site, we didn’t have to focus on different levels of authorship, and can focus on the administrator level for now.

For those unfamiliar with Squarespace, the site allows you to select from a number of custom templates, all of which have some level of e-commerce features (the main point of the site). Luckily, my coworker already had a basic version of the website design via Weebly, so after we decided on a template, I was able to sketch out a basic mockup for the site based on that preset design.

Once I have the basic mockup and style complete, I usually get down to business and start a free trial. While I have heard of some designers having the client set up the site and then have them give access to you, I personally prefer setting up a trial site and then giving the client access via an administrator link. This protects their privacy, and gives me a chance to do the initial setup and then display it to them after I’ve gotten a working/functional site down.

From there, I start customizing the template. For this project I used the Tremont template, which has a gorgeous slideshow-like home page, but more standard individual and blog pages. One of the most important things to me alongside covering the clients preferences is to promote accessibility and usability on my sites, so I’m always mindful of the color scheme, language choices, and structure of my content when building out a site.

After building the template, I spend most of my time within the style editor, ensuring that the color scheme and display are in line with the client’s request. Making sure everything is presented in a sleek and easily digestible way is crucial, especially for an e-commerce site. I also typically make use of the Custom CSS section, as I prefer to add my own styling to the overall layout of the site, and check to make sure it’s compatible across multiple devices and browsers.

After I have a sustainable working model, I’ll send an invite to the client so that they can see the layout and make suggestions and changes. My coworker was already familiar with Squarespace, so he was able to easily jump right in and see the portions that he wanted to change or keep the same. In the end, the final model stayed relatively unchanged from the initial model with the except of styling and minor individual page layout modifications.

Once the final model is complete, I work on connecting the domain and any underlying accounts that the client wants to add (ex: G-Suite, Google Analytics, Dropbox, etc.). Afterwards, I focus on clearing up any underlying questions regarding the site or Squarespace in general and send over my invoice. It’s incredibly satisfying to see the final version of a product, and both the client and customers can bring the site to life. For example, here’s the gallery page for Prism Products:

This was a really exciting project, and I’m glad I got to work on it as one of my first dives into design and development. I can’t wait to see where [Prism](https://www.prism-products.us/) goes, and they have a lot of great products and content that I recommend checking out.
